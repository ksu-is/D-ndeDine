# DondeDine
# A potential app that decides what one may eat with their partner to remove the headache of being indecisive and not knowing what to eat. 
- Have you ever wanted to go eat out somewhere with your significant other but kept arguing and being indecisive on where to go and end up being both frustrated and hungry?
- Well with DondeDine, you can eliminate that by putting names of places you and your significant other want to go eat at and it will randomize a choice from both list or select the items that have matched.
